Do you want to train your code typing so that you can code faster? Do you want to simulate some code so that you can test some shortcuts? Here comes `{fasttyper}`! The goal of this package is to print some code in the console that you have to rewrite without making any mistakes.

For now, it only has three levels (that you can call with the `level_*()` functions), and it is mainly focused on tidyverse functions. You can install it with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fasttyper")
```
